          Data should be provided in JSON format using a PUT request.

          A timestamp is added to the data automatically and is not required.

          Units can optionally be provided by providing an object with a `value` and `units` field instead of just a value:

        ## Without units
            {
              temperature: 20
            }

        ## With units
            {
              temperature: {
                value: 20,
                units: "C"
